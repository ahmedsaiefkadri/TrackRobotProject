# TrackRobotProject

Overview
This project involves designing and building a track robot using custom 3D-printed components and an Arduino Uno for hardware control. The robot will be programmed using C++ to achieve precise movement and performance on the track.

Objectives
Design and 3D print all necessary hardware components.
Utilize the Arduino Uno and additional hardware (e.g., sensors, motors) for control systems.
Program the robot's functions using C++ for efficient operation.
Technologies
Hardware: 3D-printed elements, Arduino Uno, sensors, motors, and other components.
Software: C++ for programming the robotâ€™s control systems.
Project Status
Currently in the design and planning phase, with 3D printing and hardware setup to follow, alongside C++ programming development.
